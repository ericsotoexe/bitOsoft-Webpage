# A reminders for myself.

Notes of topic that I do not know enough.
I will just put that aside for the time being, and later we can dig it in.

1. Media queries: Use different CSS for different screen sizes.
2. Flexbox: Learn more about positioning content in CSS.
3. Responsive Images: Send different sized images files to different devices based on their size and pixel density.
4. Differences between SECTION and DIV.
5. ''Position'', absolute, relative, etc...
6. Use Figma (free version) to design and later code.
7. Use Animate.style to find CSS animations .
8. Margins.
9. Bootstrap v5 (CSS library and more).

Other funnier ways to learn about web design it is taking inspiration from other websites; looking behind scene what are they doing and how. Just ''inspect'' those elements in your internet browser.
